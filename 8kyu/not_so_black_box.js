// Not so black box

// The kata has been preloaded with a function called blackBox. Figure out what the function does.

// You may need to think laterally!

// SOLUTION:

let message = blackBox + ''
console.log(message)
//blackBox('you call JSopenSesame(), you'll pass!'')

blackBox(JSopenSesame());
